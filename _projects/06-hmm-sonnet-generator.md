Shakespearean-like sonnet generator based on
[hidden Markov models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model).
Includes a general-use Python implementation of the
[Baum-Welch algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baum%E2%80%93Welch_algorithm)
for unsupervised training of HMMs and a tokenizer module for parsing a corpus into
tokens suitable for model training.
